Fluff is a fork of [Sangou](https://github.com/dfault-user/fluff), which is a fork of [robocop-ng](https://github.com/reswitched/robocop-ng). Contributions to the fork were made by @dfault-user and Marr, who's bunny is the namesake of this bot.

# Usage

Fluff is currently not available for public use, but self-hosting instructions are available below. All command documentation currently heeds to [Sangou's original documentation](https://3gou.0ccu.lt/).

- Download the bot from this repository. Stick to the release versions unless you have encountered a bug.
- Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
- Use `pipenv install` in the root folder, where `Pipfile` is.
- Copy `config.example.py` to `config.py`, and fill it out with your bot information.
- Enter `pipenv shell`, `cd sangou`, then `python __init__.py`.
- Congratulations.

I will not help you if you wish to use a `requirements.txt`. It is much easier to just use `pipenv`.
